In this project, I chose a yellow color for the NavHeader to symbolize visibility, attention, and positivity, enhancing the overall user experience. I also incorporated icons with colors to make the interface more intuitive and visually clear.

For the cards, I implemented a badge system to indicate the status, for example, when the skip waste is "Not Allowed On The Road", a badge highlights this condition. Additionally, I used a switch toggle instead of a traditional button, providing a more interactive and user-friendly method for selecting cards.

To improve interactivity, I added hover animations on each card. This helps guide users and makes the selection process more engaging and dynamic.
